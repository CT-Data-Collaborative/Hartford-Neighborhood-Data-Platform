# Hartford Neighborhood Data Platform

This dataset powers the [Hartford Neighborhood Data Platform](https://www.ctdata.org/hartford-neighborhood-data-platform). Data comes from the 2023 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. 

Census tract-level data was aggregated to Hartford neighborhoods. Census tracts were assigned to neighborhoods based on the neighborhood that the center of the tract was within. More information about the relationship between census tracts and Hartford neighborhoods can be found [here](https://github.com/CT-Data-Collaborative/hartford-crosswalks).

More information about each variable is available in the Data Dictionary.

### What are margins of error?

Because the ACS is a survey that does not reach all residents, there is error associated with the data. According to the Census Bureau, margins of error measure the possble variation of an estimate around its true value. They allow data users to be certain that the estimate and the actual value differ by no more than the value of the margin of error.

For example, in Clay-Arsenal, the total population estimate is 6,462 and the margin of error is 748. By adding and subtracting the margin of error from the total population estimate, we can be 90% confident that the true population of Clay-Arsenal is between 5,714 and 7,209.

Margins of error can be very large, especially for smaller data points. **Use caution when interpreting data points with large margins of error.**
